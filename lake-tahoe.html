      <h1><strong>South Lake Tahoe</strong></h1>
      <h2>My Favorite Place To Vacation</h2>

      <p><strong>Lake Tahoe is largest alpine lake in the United States!</strong></p>
      <p>I make it my mission to make it down atleast once a year. Aside from being the largest lake in the US, it's also one of the cleanest lakes in the US. 
        One of the only lakes in America that doesnt experience true drought issues, since the snow creats majority of the lakes water.</p>

      <p>A few things I enjoy when I come to visit:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Paddle boarding</li>
        <li>Camping</li>
        <li>Sunrises & Sunsets</li>
        <li>Hiking</li>
        <li>Local breweries</li>
        <li>Time with my best friends in the world</li>
      </ul>

    <p>I can't wait to go back, and make more memories in this beautiful place.</p>
